## Installation ##
This repository uses cvxpy for the construction of the optimization problems and PyTorch for training the neural network models. The necessary Python packages can be instaled by running the following command:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

We use the [Gurobi](https://support.gurobi.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/360046430451/comments/360005981732) commcercial solver for solving the problems.
